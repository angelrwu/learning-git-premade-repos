# Learning repositories for practicing git.

## Why use this?
The main purpose of this repository is to get rid of that initial setup and reset when you are learning about git and how to modify the commit history. 
This is meant for people who already know how to commit and the bare basic of how to create a repo, but don't fully understand how to fix, edit and deal with branches.
This removes the initial set up and let's you practice those specific skills.

## How to use it.
- Unzip the file 
- Make a copy
- Open the terminal in the file you want
- Do one of the exercise or experiment

### Alternative use
I've also individually separated all of the file into their own repos if you wish to do a pull and reset between attempts. Check my repos for them.
